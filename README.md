# Graph Representation Learning

This repository contains my attempted practicals for the Oxford Department of Computer Science Part C course [Graph Reperesentation Learning](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/teaching/courses/2024-2025/grl/) lectured by [Ismail Ilkan Ceylan](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/ismaililkan.ceylan/) in Michaelmas 2024.
- Practical 1: Implementation of knowledge graph embeddings (TransE, RotatE)
  - Dataset: [Nations](https://github.com/ZhenfengLei/KGDatasets/tree/master/Nations)
- Practical 2: Implementation of a base GNN from scratch for node classification
  - Dataset: [Cora](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/torch_geometric.datasets.CitationFull.html#torch_geometric.datasets.CitationFull)
- Practical 3: Implementation of graph mini-batching and graph pooling for graph classification
  - Dataset: [TUDataset](https://chrsmrrs.github.io/datasets/)
- Practical 4: Over-Smoothing in deep GNNs
  - Dataset: [Cora](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/torch_geometric.datasets.CitationFull.html#torch_geometric.datasets.CitationFull)
- Practical 5: Implementation of $1$-WL hash algorithm
  - Dataset: Cycles 
  $\mathcal{C}_{n}$ 
  and disjoint union of two cycles 
  $\mathcal{D}_{n,i}$.
